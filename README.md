# Would You Rather Project

In the "Would You Rather?" Project is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game. The game goes like this: A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Users will be able to answer questions, see which questions they haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard. The app is developed using React JS and Redux. This is a project for the Udacity's React Fundamentals course, part of the React Nanodegree Program.
